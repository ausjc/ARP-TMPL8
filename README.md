# ARP-TMPL8
A large arpeggio template for the Dirtywave M8.

This template builds off of the great example set by nchowning https://github.com/nchowning/M8-template

DEMONSTRATION:

HOW TO USE:

Rename this file as "template.m8s" and save within the SYSTEM folder of your M8's SD card. This file will now be the default template for all new songs.

Insert a note within a new phrase and use the TBLXX function to choose the arpeggio/slide you prefer, starting from TBL80. Raise or lower the TBL. TIC within the instrument page to alter the speed that the arpeggio cycles. Each of the below patterns have 3 corresponding chord shapes from the original nchowning template that are used (i.e. 3 versions of the 1 octave ascending loop, 3 versions of the 2 octave ascending loop and so on).

Major patterns
- Tables 80 -> 8E: Ascending (1, 2, 3, 4 and infinite octaves)
- Tables 90 -> 9E: Descending (1, 2, 3, 4 and infinite octaves)
- Tables A0 -> AE: Left hand piano style arpeggios (1-3-5-3; 1-5-3-5; 1-5-1-5-3; stutter ascending; stutter descending)

Minor patterns
- Tables B0 -> BE: Ascending (1, 2, 3, 4 and infinite octaves)
- Tables C0 -> CE: Descending (1, 2, 3, 4 and infinite octaves)
- Tables D0 -> DE: Left hand piano style arpeggios (1-3-5-3; 1-5-3-5; 1-5-1-5-3; stutter ascending; stutter descending)

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - I have removed all utility KILL function phrases, empty phrases, preloaded instruments etc. (personal preference)
 - Ninety new arpeggios are found across tables 80 -> DF
 - Slide tables remain in tables E0 -> FF
 - Chain F0 has no notes but holds all tables 80 -> FF as functions and is found in the final line of the song (avoids deletion with "clear unused" function)
 - I have deliberately avoided facilitating any THO commands despite their space saving capability, as I believe they add a layer of friction when trying to skim through sounds that might suit your song. Feel free to insert these as necessary, or make additional changes (e.g. extending/shortening the "stutter" patterns).
